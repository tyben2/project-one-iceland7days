					<h3>Getting to and around Iceland</h3>
					<br>
					<p>We flew non-stop into the Keflavik international airport. It was about a 7-8 hour flight from our hometown of Portland, Oregon. The whole airport is a huge layover hub to countless cities all over the world, meaning that there is a good chance that your flight could be non-stop (which is a very good thing!)

Once you get to the airport, we highly recommend that you buy any necessities from their duty-free store. They have a wide range of snacks and alcohol that will be much cheaper there than anywhere else on the island.

We rented a car and don’t regret it. Ultimately you will spend a good deal of time in a vehicle whether its your own car or in a travel bus (Iceland is sprawled out!) Having a car allowed us more control over our time and destinations. TIP: Take photos of any damage that you initially see on your rental car. The car rental agencies are merciless!

						<h3>Real sweet hotel!</h3>
						<br>
						<p>There are many great choices for lodging throughout the island. There are countless Air-bnb options throughout the island that are clean and affordable.  If you go with a hotel, find one with extra amenities, like complimentary breakfast or a special hot-tub. We stayed our first couple nights at Hotel Berg in Keflavik and it was a great choice. The whole hotel had just been renovated and made our initial stay very relaxing.
