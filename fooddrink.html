						<h3>Wait, a beer costs how much?</h3>
						<p><br>Let me say this in all-caps ICELAND IS EXPENSIVE! Things from alcohol, to eggs, to coffee tend to be 30% more expensive than what we were used to in the states. A typical beer at a bar could run you upwards of $12. Remember when we suggested that you buy your alcohol at the airports duty-free store in accommodations? When you do go out to drink, find out who has a good happy-hour.
<br><br>

We can’t even begin to tell you how good Iceland’s food is. Its uniquely cooked with fresh produce and meat. Seafood and lamb is delicious and plentiful and far less expensive to beef or chicken which typically has to be shipped to the island. We also saw many restaurants that specialize in vegan and vegetarian food. TIP: Iceland loves their hotdogs and so do we! They are very inexpensive and a great choice for a quick lunch. Try the hotdog stands in Reykjavik called “Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur.”

								<h3>Save some money!</h3>
								<br>
								<p>A great way to budget for the trip is to cook some of your meals. Find an Air-bnb that comes with a kitchen. We cooked our own breakfasts and made some fresh pasta for dinner for one night. There are many grocery store options but we find that “Kronan” had the best selection and prices.
