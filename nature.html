			<h3>Game of Thrones filming locations</h3>
				<BR>
				<p>We scheduled our trip to be in nature for at least half the time. We saw many people that rented camping vans and traveled around the island but that wasn’t our scene. Day trips were perfect for us. A lot of our travels were designed around major tourist stops and “Game of Thrones” filming locations. There are many books and websites dedicated to the details of these filming locations and we highly recommend that you check those out. <BR><BR>

<h3>The Golden Circle</h3> <BR>This took about 4 hours of driving time and we saw so much! The Golden Circle includes Gullfoss Waterfall, Thingvellir National Park and Geysir geothermal area. Dress warm and bring some good shoes. There is a lot of places to see while on foot. 
<BR><BR>
<h3>Black Sand Beach</h3> <BR>The beaches along the south part of the island are gorgeous and unique. The volcanic mountains mixed with the beaches reminded us of a cold Hawaii. Reynisfjara was our ultimate destination taking about two hours each way. The rock formations in Reynisfjara were out of this world and used for parts of the great wall in Game of Thrones.
<BR><BR>
<h3>Kirkjufell</h3><BR> The arrow shaped mountain of Kirkjufell was our longest drive, clocking in at about three hours each way but it was worth it! The mountain was used in an important battle in the seventh season of GOT and for good reason. It surrounds a quiet little town with a gorgeous waterfall next to it. The mountain is hike able if you want or just stay at the bottom taking photos. We found the scenery during the drive to be the most unique compared to other parts of Iceland.
